				EULA shall apply.
			</p>

				be referred to as “YAXIE”, “we” or “us”).</br></br>
				You are reading the terms of service (the “Terms”), which govern the relationship and serve as an agreement between
				you and us and set forth the terms and conditions by which you may access and use the Platform and our related
				websites, services, applications, products and content (collectively, the “Services”). Our Services are provided
				for private, non-commercial use. For purposes of these Terms, “you” and “your” means you as the user of the
				Services.</br></br>
				The Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and us. Please take the time to read them carefully.</br></br>
				ARBITRATION NOTICE FOR USERS IN THE UNITED STATES: THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND A WAIVER OF RIGHTS
				TO BRING A CLASS ACTION AGAINST US. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE, YOU
				AND YAXIE AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND YAXIE WAIVE
				ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.</p></br>
			<p class="h3">2.Accepting the Terms</p>
			<p class="h2">By accessing or using our Services, you confirm that you can form a binding contract with YAXIE, that
				you accept these Terms and that you agree to comply with them. Your access to and use of our Services is also
				subject to our Privacy Policy and Community Policy, the terms of which can be found directly on the Platform, or
				where the Platform is made available for download, on your mobile device’s applicable app store, and are
				incorporated herein by reference. By using the Services, you consent to the terms of the Privacy Policy.</br></br>
				If you access or use the Services from within a jurisdiction for which there are separate supplemental terms, you
				also hereby agree to the supplemental terms applicable to users in each jurisdiction as outlined below, and in the
				event of a conflict between the provisions of the Supplemental Terms – Jurisdiction-Specificthat are relevant to
				your jurisdiction from which you access or use the Services, and the rest of these Terms, the relevant
				jurisdictions’ Supplemental Terms – Jurisdiction-Specific will supersede and control. If you do not agree to these
				Terms, you must not access or use our Services.</br></br>
				If you are accessing or using the Services on behalf of a business or entity, then (a) “you” and “your” includes
				you and that business or entity, (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the
				business or entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and that you agree to these Terms on the
				entity’s behalf, and (c) your business or entity is legally and financially responsible for your access or use of
				the Services as well as for the access or use of your account by others affiliated with your entity, including any
				employees, agents or contractors.</br></br>
				You can accept the Terms by accessing or using our Services. You understand and agree that we will treat your
				access or use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.
				You should print off or save a local copy of the Terms for your records.
			</p>
			<p class="h3">3.Changes to the Terms</p>
			<p class="h2">We amend these Terms from time to time, for instance when we update the functionality of our Services,
				when we combine multiple apps or services operated by us or our affiliates into a single combined service or app,
				or when there are regulatory changes. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to generally notify all users of
				any material changes to these Terms, such as through a notice on our Platform, however, you should look at the
				Terms regularly to check for such changes. We will also update the “Last Updated” date at the top of these Terms,
				which reflect the effective date of such Terms. Your continued access or use of the Services after the date of the
				new Terms constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, you must stop
				accessing or using the Services.</p>
			<p class="h3">4.Your Account with Us</p>
			<p class="h2">To access or use some of our Services, you must create an account with us. When you create this
				account, you must provide accurate and up-to-date information. It is important that you maintain and promptly
				update your details and any other information you provide to us, to keep such information current and complete.</br></br>
				It is important that you keep your account password confidential and that you do not disclose it to any third
				party. If you know or suspect that any third party knows your password or has accessed your account, you must
				promptly notify us at SparkNewsapp@gmail.com.</br></br>
				You agree that you are solely responsible (to us and to others) for the activity that occurs under your account.</br></br>
				We reserve the right to disable your user account at any time, including if you have failed to comply with any of
				the provisions of these Terms, or if activities occur on your account which, in our sole discretion, would or might
				cause damage to or impair the Services or infringe or violate any third party rights, or violate any applicable
				laws or regulations.</br></br>

				you. Please contact us via SparkNewsapp@gmail.com, and we will provide you with further assistance and guide you
				through the process. Once you choose to delete your account, you will not be able to reactivate your account or

				Community Policy.</br></br>
				We reserve the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to content at our

				relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.
				This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.</br>
				<p class="h3">6.Intellectual Property Rights</p>
				<p class="h2">We respect intellectual property rights and ask you to do the same. As a condition of your access to
					and use of the Services, you agree not to use the Services to infringe on any intellectual property rights. We

				<p class="h3">7.Content</p>
				<p class="h2">A. YAXIE Content</br></br>
					As between you and YAXIE, all content, software, images, text, graphics, illustrations, logos, patents,
					trademarks, service marks, copyrights, photographs, audio, videos, music on and “look and feel” of the Services,
					and all intellectual property rights related thereto (the “YAXIE Content”), are either owned or licensed by YAXIE,
					it being understood that you or your licensors will own any User Content (as defined below) you upload or transmit
					through the Services. Use of the YAXIE Content or materials on the Services for any purpose not expressly
					permitted by these Terms is strictly prohibited. Such content may not be downloaded, copied, reproduced,
					distributed, transmitted, broadcast, displayed, sold, licensed or otherwise exploited for any purpose whatsoever
					without our or, where applicable, our licensors’ prior written consent. We and our licensors reserve all rights
					not expressly granted in and to their content.</br></br>
					You acknowledge and agree that we may generate revenues, increase goodwill or otherwise increase our value from
					your use of the Services, including, by way of example and not limitation, through the sale of advertising,
					sponsorships, promotions, usage data and Gifts (defined below), and except as specifically permitted by us in
					these Terms or in another agreement you enter into with us, you will have no right to share in any such revenue,
					goodwill or value whatsoever. You further acknowledge that, except as specifically permitted by us in these Terms
					or in another agreement you enter into with us, you (i) have no right to receive any income or other consideration
					from any User Content (defined below) or your use of any musical works, sound recordings or audiovisual clips made
					available to you on or through the Services, including in any User Content created by you, and (ii) are prohibited
					from exercising any rights to monetize or obtain consideration from any User Content within the Services or on any
					third party service ( e.g. , you cannot claim User Content that has been uploaded to a social media platform such
					as YouTube for monetization).</br></br>
					Subject to the terms and conditions of the Terms, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited,
					non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, worldwide license to access and use the Services, including to
					download the Platform on a permitted device, and to access the YAXIE Content solely for your personal,
					non-commercial use through your use of the Services and solely in compliance with these Terms. YAXIE reserves all
					rights not expressly granted herein in the Services and the YAXIE Content. You acknowledge and agree that YAXIE
					may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason.</br></br>
					NO RIGHTS ARE LICENSED WITH RESPECT TO SOUND RECORDINGS AND THE MUSICAL WORKS EMBODIED THEREIN THAT ARE MADE
					AVAILABLE FROM OR THROUGH THE SERVICE.</br></br>
					You acknowledge and agree that when you view content provided by others on the Services, you are doing so at your
					own risk. The content on our Services is provided for general information only. It is not intended to amount to
					advice on which you should rely. You must obtain professional or specialist advice before taking, or refraining
					from, any action on the basis of the content on our Services.</br></br>
					We make no representations, warranties or guarantees, whether express or implied, that any YAXIE Content
					(including User Content) is accurate, complete or up to date. Where our Services contain links to other sites and
					resources provided by third parties, these links are provided for your information only. We have no control over
					the contents of those sites or resources. Such links should not be interpreted as approval by us of those linked
					websites or information you may obtain from them. You acknowledge that we have no obligation to pre-screen,
					monitor, review, or edit any content posted by you and other users on the Services (including User Content).
					</br></br>
					B. User-Generated Content</br></br>
					Users of the Services may be permitted to upload, post or transmit (such as via a stream) or otherwise make
					available content through the Services including, without limitation, any text, photographs, user videos, sound
					recordings and the musical works embodied therein, including videos that incorporate locally stored sound
					recordings from your personal music library and ambient noise (“User Content”). Users of the Services may also
					extract all or any portion of User Content created by another user to produce additional User Content, including
					collaborative User Content with other users, that combine and intersperse User Content generated by more than one
					user. Users of the Services may also overlay music, graphics, stickers, Virtual Items (as defined and further
					explained in the “Supplemental Terms – Virtual Items Policy“) and other elements provided by YAXIE (“YAXIE
					Elements”) onto this User Content and transmit this User Content through the Services. The information and
					materials in the User Content, including User Content that includes YAXIE Elements, have not been verified or
					approved by us. The views expressed by other users on the Services (including through use of the virtual gifts) do
					not represent our views or values.</br></br>
					Whenever you access or use a feature that allows you to upload or transmit User Content through the Services
					(including via certain third party social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter), or to
					make contact with other users of the Services, you must comply with the standards set out at “Your Access to and
					Use of Our Services” above. You may also choose to upload or transmit your User Content, including User Content
					that includes YAXIE Elements, on sites or platforms hosted by third parties. If you decide to do this, you must
					comply with their content guidelines as well as with the standards set out at “Your Access to and Use of Our
					Services” above.</br></br>
					You warrant that any such contribution does comply with those standards, and you will be liable to us and
					indemnify us for any breach of that warranty. This means you will be responsible for any loss or damage we suffer
					as a result of your breach of warranty.</br></br>
					Any User Content will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary. You must not post any User Content on or
					through the Services or transmit to us any User Content that you consider to be confidential or proprietary. When
					you submit User Content through the Services, you agree and represent that you own that User Content, or you have
					received all necessary permissions, clearances from, or are authorised by, the owner of any part of the content to
					submit it to the Services, to transmit it from the Services to other third party platforms, and/or adopt any third
					party content.</br></br>
					If you only own the rights in and to a sound recording, but not to the underlying musical works embodied in such
					sound recordings, then you must not post such sound recordings to the Services unless you have all permissions,
					clearances from, or are authorised by, the owner of any part of the content to submit it to the Services.</br></br>
					You or the owner of your User Content still own the copyright in User Content sent to us, but by submitting User
					Content via the Services, you hereby grant us an unconditional irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully
					transferable, perpetual worldwide licence to use, modify, adapt, reproduce, make derivative works of, publish
					and/or transmit, and/or distribute and to authorise other users of the Services and other third-parties to view,
					access, use, download, modify, adapt, reproduce, make derivative works of, publish and/or transmit your User
					Content in any format and on any platform, either now known or hereinafter invented.</br></br>
					You further grant us a royalty-free license to use your user name, image, voice, and likeness to identify you as
					the source of any of your User Content.</br></br>
					For the avoidance of doubt, the rights granted in the preceding paragraphs of this Section include, but are not
					limited to, the right to reproduce sound recordings (and make mechanical reproductions of the musical works
					embodied in such sound recordings), and publicly perform and communicate to the public sound recordings (and the
					musical works embodied therein), all on a royalty-free basis. This means that you are granting us the right to use
					your User Content without the obligation to pay royalties to any third party, including, but not limited to, a
					sound recording copyright owner (e.g., a record label), a musical work copyright owner (e.g., a music publisher),
					a performing rights organization (e.g., ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, etc.) (a “PRO”), a sound recording PRO (e.g.,
					SoundExchange), any unions or guilds, and engineers, producers or other royalty participants involved in the
					creation of User Content.</br></br>
					Specific Rules for Musical Works and for Recording Artists . If you are a composer or author of a musical work and
					are affiliated with a PRO, then you must notify your PRO of the royalty-free license you grant through these Terms
					in your User Content to us. You are solely responsible for ensuring your compliance with the relevant PRO’s
					reporting obligations. If you have assigned your rights to a music publisher, then you must obtain the consent of
					such music publisher to grant the royalty-free license(s) set forth in these Terms in your User Content or have
					such music publisher enter into these Terms with us. Just because you authored a musical work (e.g., wrote a song)
					does not mean you have the right to grant us the licenses in these Terms. If you are a recording artist under
					contract with a record label, then you are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of the Services is in
					compliance with any contractual obligations you may have to your record label, including if you create any new
					recordings through the Services that may be claimed by your label.</br></br>
					Through-To-The-Audience Rights. All of the rights you grant in your User Content in these Terms are provided on a
					through-to-the-audience basis, meaning the owners or operators of third party services will not have any separate
					liability to you or any other third party for User Content posted or used on such third party service via the
					Services.</br></br>
					Waiver of Rights to User Content. By posting User Content to or through the Services, you waive any rights to
					prior inspection or approval of any marketing or promotional materials related to such User Content. You also
					waive any and all rights of privacy, publicity, or any other rights of a similar nature in connection with your
					User Content, or any portion thereof. To the extent any moral rights are not transferable or assignable, you
					hereby waive and agree never to assert any and all moral rights, or to support, maintain or permit any action
					based on any moral rights that you may have in or with respect to any User Content you Post to or through the
					Services.</br></br>
					We also have the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any User Content posted
					or uploaded by you to our Services constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights, or of their
					right to privacy.</br></br>
					We, or authorised third parties, reserve the right to cut, crop, edit or refuse to publish, your content at our or
					their sole discretion. We have the right to remove, disallow, block or delete any posting you make on our Services
					if, in our opinion, your post does not comply with the content standards set out at “Your Access to and Use of Our
					Services”above. In addition, we have the right – but not the obligation – in our sole discretion to remove,
					disallow, block or delete any User Content (i) that we consider to violate these Terms, or (ii) in response to
					complaints from other users or third parties, with or without notice and without any liability to you. As a
					result, we recommend that you save copies of any User Content that you post to the Services on your personal
					device(s) in the event that you want to ensure that you have permanent access to copies of such User Content. We
					do not guarantee the accuracy, integrity, appropriateness or quality of any User Content, and under no
					circumstances will we be liable in any way for any User Content.</br></br>
					You control whether your User Content is made publicly available on the Services to all other users of the
					Services or only available to people you approve. To restrict access to your User Content, you should select the
					privacy setting available within the Platform.</br></br>
					We accept no liability in respect of any content submitted by users and published by us or by authorised third
					parties.</br></br>
					If you wish to complain about information and materials uploaded by other users please contact us
					at:SparkNewsapp@gmail.com.</br></br>
					YAXIE takes reasonable measures to expeditiously remove from our Services any infringing material that we become
					aware of.It is YAXIE’s policy, in appropriate circumstances and at its discretion, to disable or terminate the
					accounts of users of the Services who repeatedly infringe copyrights or intellectual property rights of others.</br></br>
					While our own staff is continually working to develop and evaluate our own product ideas and features, we pride
					ourselves on paying close attention to the interests, feedback, comments, and suggestions we receive from the user
					community. If you choose to contribute by sending us or our employees any ideas for products, services, features,
					modifications, enhancements, content, refinements, technologies, content offerings (such as audio, visual, games,
					or other types of content), promotions, strategies, or product/feature names, or any related documentation,
					artwork, computer code, diagrams, or other materials (collectively “Feedback”), then regardless of what your
					accompanying communication may say, the following terms will apply, so that future misunderstandings can be
					avoided. Accordingly, by sending Feedback to us , you agree that:</br>
					i. YAXIE has no obligation to review, consider, or implement your Feedback, or to return to you all or part of any
					Feedback for any reason;</br>
					ii. Feedback is provided on a non-confidential basis, and we are not under any obligation to keep any Feedback you
					send confidential or to refrain from using or disclosing it in any way; and</br>
					iii. You irrevocably grant us perpetual and unlimited permission to reproduce, distribute, create derivative works
					of, modify, publicly perform (including on a through-to-the-audience basis), communicate to the public, make
					available, publicly display, and otherwise use and exploit the Feedback and derivatives thereof for any purpose
					and without restriction, free of charge and without attribution of any kind, including by making, using, selling,
					offering for sale, importing, and promoting commercial products and services that incorporate or embody Feedback,
					whether in whole or in part, and whether as provided or as modified.</br>
					</br>

					and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors from any and all claims,

					breach by you or any user of your account of these Terms or arising out of a breach of your obligations,
					representation and warranties under these Terms.</p>

					purchase, please contact us. We will let you know if this change is possible. Please note that changes may impact
					price as well as other aspects of the product. You have certain rights to withdraw from a purchase under the

					agree that we start supplying the Coins to you promptly once the purchase is complete and therefore, your right to
					cancel or withdraw from the agreement to purchase is lost at this point.]</br>

					or any other form of credit. Coins can only be used on our Platform and as part of our Services, and cannot be

					is expressly prohibited. Accrued Coins do not constitute property and are not transferable: (a) upon death; (b) as

					account, and/or liability for damages and litigation and transaction costs.</br>

					account of any User that is deemed to be abusing this provision.</br>

					item of User Content that is uploaded or streamed by another user (“Content Provider”). When this functionality is

					up in your account, and converted into Diamond (as defined and further explained below) in the Content Provider’s

					clarity, users cannot purchase Diamonds.</br>

					payment channel account (if applicable). Your first and last name needs to be an exact match to your PayPal
					account information and your PayPal account needs to be verified. It is your responsibility to ensure that you

					caused by incorrect PayPal (or other payment channel) account information provided by you. Payment will not be
					sent to a PayPal account with an email address, a first and last name different from what appears on your account,
					and an account that has not been verified with PayPal;</br>
					• we may, at our sole discretion, request you to provide information to verify your identity (including your first
					and last name and your state ID number). We reserve the right to verify your identity (by requesting a photocopy
					of your state ID card, or other proof as we may require) and eligibility qualifications to our satisfaction prior
					to making any payment; and</br>
					• any withdrawal request to be fulfilled to users under the age of 18 may be, at our sole discretion, fulfilled in
					the name of the user’s parent or legal guardian (subject to evidence of such relationship and relevant identities
					being verified if required by us in our sole discretion).</br>
					• Although we aim to fulfil all withdrawal requests in a timely manner, we do not guarantee fulfilment within a
					specific period of time (including any estimated timings set out at the time of withdrawal) and we will not be
					liable to you or any third party for any failure to fulfil a withdrawal request within such time.</br>
					• If you wish to convert the amount into a currency other than USD, this option may be available within your
					PayPal (or other payment channel if applicable) account but this is at the discretion of PayPal (or other payment
					channel if applicable) and the terms and conditions of PayPal (or other payment channel if applicable), including
					any applicable fees, will apply to such currency conversion.</br>
					• If you are subject to any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on these payments, you will be responsible for the
					payment of such taxes (including any related penalties or interest) to the relevant tax authority. We reserve the
					right to deduct any applicable taxes prior to making such payment if we determine that we are required to do so by
					applicable law. We also reserve the right to request certifications from you in relation to taxes and to report to
					tax authorities amounts paid and/or withheld from payments to you.</br>

					operation of the Diamond incentive at any time [on reasonable notice or, if there is a valid reason for our
					cancellation, on limited or no notice.] [If we cancel the Diamond incentive, you shall have no right or
					entitlement to any financial compensation in respect of any Diamond accrued prior to the date of cancellation of
					the initiative that has not been converted into cash using the mechanism set out in these Terms.]</br>

					Supplemental Terms – Jurisdiction-Specific</br></br>
					USA. . If you are using our Services in the USA, the following additional terms apply:</br>
					• Applicable Law and Jurisdiction.These Terms, their subject matter and their formation, including any arbitration
					proceeds outlined below, are governed by New York law.</br>
					• ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</br>
					o This Section includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an
					individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding). Please read it carefully. You
					may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below.</br>
					o Informal Process First. You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and YAXIE, you will first contact
					YAXIE and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of
					resolution, including without limitation any court action.
					o Arbitration Agreement. After the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or
					claim (collectively, “Claim”) relating in any way to your use of YAXIE’s services and/or products, including the
					Services, or relating in any way to the communications between you and YAXIE or any other user of the Services,
					will be finally resolved by binding arbitration. This mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and
					YAXIE. However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by YAXIE for infringement of its
					intellectual property or access to the Services that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these
					Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases. If you are
					an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you
					access or use this Services by following the procedure described below.</br>
					o You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision,
					and that you and YAXIE are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This
					arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms.
					o The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if
					you are an individual, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. If you are not an
					individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for
					Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling
					1-800-778-7879.</br>
					o Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. If you are an
					individual and have not accessed or used the Services on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for
					claims where the amount in dispute is less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are
					frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the
					claims are frivolous.</br>
					o The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute
					relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of
					this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or
					voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the “Class Action Waiver” section below.</br>
					o If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with YAXIE and you are an individual, you may opt out of this
					arbitration agreement by sending an email to SparkNewsapp@gmail.com within thirty (30) days of the first of the
					date you access or use the Services.</br>
					o Class Action Waiver: Any Claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a
					plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar
					proceeding (“Class Action”). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If
					the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims
					or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim
					that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined
					only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to
					litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative
					action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.</br>
					o If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if
					otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in
					favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that
					party's individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and YAXIE
					each waive any right to a jury trial.</br>
					• Removal of Infringing Materials – Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy</br>
					o Anyone who believes that his or her work has been reproduced in the Services in a manner which constitutes
					copyright infringement may submit a notification to YAXIE’s copyright agent in accordance with the Digital
					Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), by providing the following information in writing:</br></br>
					identification of the copyrighted work that is claimed to be infringed;</br>
					identification of the allegedly infringing material that is requested to be removed, including a description of
					where it is located on the Services;</br>
					information for our copyright agent to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available,
					e-mail address;</br>
					a statement that you have a good faith belief that the identified, allegedly infringing use is not authorized by
					the copyright owners, its agent or the law;
					a statement that the information above is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner
					or the authorized person to act on behalf of the copyright owner; and</br>
					a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or of an
					exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</br>
					o If you are asserting infringement of an intellectual property right other than copyright, please specify the
					intellectual property right at issue (for example, “trademark”) by notating this in your written notice. You
					acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements for a notice of infringement as specified
					above, your DMCA notice may not be valid.</br>
					o If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) after we received a
					notice of copyright infringement is not actually infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright
					owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the content in your User Content, you
					may send a counter-notice containing the following information to YAXIE’s Copyright Agent: (1) your physical or
					electronic signature (with your full legal name); (2) identification of the content that has been removed or to
					which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
					(3) a statement that you have a good faith belief, under penalty of perjury, that the content was removed or
					disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and (4) your name, address, telephone
					number, and email address, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided
					the original notification of the alleged infringement.</br>
					o If a counter-notice is received by YAXIE’s Copyright Agent, we may send a copy of the counter-notice to the
					original complaining party informing that person that we may replace the removed content or cease disabling it.
					Unless the original complaining party files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member
					or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in ten business days or more after receipt
					of the counter-notice, at YAXIE’s sole discretion.</br>
					o Please understand that filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the
					complaining party to determine ownership. Be aware that there may be adverse legal consequences in your country if
					you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.</br>
